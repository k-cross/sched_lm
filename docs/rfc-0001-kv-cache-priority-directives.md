# RFC 0001: KV-cache retention directives from llm-d to vLLM

- **Status**: Draft — open for async iteration
- **Created**: 2026-07-15 (revised same week to align with upstream RFC vllm#37003 and its design doc)
- **Scope**: this bench (prototype) → upstream `llm-d-router` / `vllm`
- **Prototype targets**: forked `llm-d-inference-sim` standing in for vLLM; custom EPP plugin standing in for llm-d-router changes

## Summary

Add a per-request cache-retention directive path from llm-d's endpoint picker (EPP) to
the vLLM backend, plus richer cache stats flowing back — prototyped end-to-end in this
bench. It aligns with two upstream efforts:

- **vllm#37003**[^1] and its design doc[^2] — a live RFC (working
  implementation, feedback window open) defining a `RetentionDirective` API:
  token-range scoped, numeric `priority` 0–100, optional `duration` TTL, attached via
  `extra_body` or an `X-KVCache-Retention-Policy` JSON header, with an optional
  `retention_scope` (session ID). Its two-queue evictor (LRU free list for unmarked
  blocks + priority min-heap for marked ones) is the vLLM-side mechanism.
- **The llm-d "Agentic Runtime" vision doc**[^3] — the umbrella: make the KV-cache
  "the primary medium of coordination" for stateful agentic programs. Frameworks taint
  requests with program IDs, priorities, and context lifetimes; llm-d manages
  lifecycle; vLLM executes. #37003 is its **PoC 2** (context-aware eviction); this repo
  is already a lightweight **PoC 3** (workload-driven benchmarking with program-level
  metrics).

**What this RFC adds on top of #37003** — a third hint origin. #37003's principle is
"orchestrator defines policy; vLLM executes," covering hints the *framework* already
knows (system prompts, tool definitions, session lifecycles). But the router sees what
no single orchestrator can: cross-tenant traffic, fleet-wide cache state, and *learned*
workload regularities. This bench's `ClassAwareReliability` policy is the concrete
example — it learns per-tool re-arrival gaps (EWMA mean + variance, from timing alone)
and predicts when a paused session will return. That knowledge lives in the EPP, not the
client. So:

- **Frameworks** originate *semantic* directives (this range is a ToolDefinition, pin
  it for the session) — the #37003 `extra_body` path, passed through the gateway.
- **llm-d** originates *learned* directives (this tool-call gap will be ~2s, keep the
  prefix warm; this request is a one-shot, evict it first) — injected by the EPP as a
  request header, reconciled with any framework directive.
- **vLLM** honors both as hints (never correctness-affecting) and reports occupancy and
  eviction-pressure stats so the layers above can tell whether their directives help.

Where this design departs from #37003's current draft, the difference is called out
inline and collected in [§7](#7-divergences-from-37003-feedback-to-file) as feedback to
file while the upstream window is open — nothing here is a silent fork.

## Motivation

The workload evidence in #37003 matches what this bench's offline simulator was built to
study: in agentic loops, >90% of a turn's tokens are reused prefix, yet 40–60% of
session wall time is spent paused on tool calls — exactly the window in which LRU, blind
to the session's imminent return, evicts the prefix under competing load. Resume becomes
a full recompute of a 70K–200K token context. Retention value is highly skewed — an
Alibaba production study found 10% of KV blocks account for 77% of reuses[^4] —
and systems that exploit it report large wins: Continuum, 1.12–3.66× delay reduction on
SWE-Bench[^5]; KVFlow, up to 2.19× speedup under concurrent multi-agent
load[^6]; Marconi, up to 34.4× higher token hit rates and 71.1% lower
TTFT[^7].

Locally, the same gap is documented in this repo[^8]: the offline sim's
`class-aware-reliability` policy soft-pins prefixes (`retain_until` in
`src/bench/sim/node.py` / `policies.py`) and wins on tool-session hit rate, but the live
stack has no way to carry that decision to the backend, and the harness scrapes back
only two prefix-cache counters.

Earlier prior art and why it stalled — and why #37003 / this design don't:

- vllm#23083[^9] (pinned prefixes, closed not-planned): unbounded pins are an
  OOM/starvation footgun. Here and in #37003, priorities are **leases** — TTL'd,
  server-capped, soft under pressure — and the server exports a pressure metric.
- vllm#44775[^10] (`cache_control` markers, closed): body-schema change without
  benchmark evidence. #37003 ships an implementation; this bench supplies the
  router-driven half of the evidence (PoC 3's role).

## Design

### 1. Directive schema: adopt #37003's, with one extension

To stay convergent with upstream, the prototype adopts the `RetentionDirective` shape as
its canonical vocabulary rather than inventing a parallel one:

```
RetentionDirective:
  start: int              # token index, inclusive
  end: int | null         # token index, exclusive; null = end of prompt
  priority: int           # 0–100
  duration: float | null  # TTL seconds; null = persistent (server-capped)
retention_scope: string   # session/program identity (vision doc: program-id taint)
```

**On the wire, priorities are strictly numeric** — the 0–100 scale plus the −1
extension below. The named classes below are **documentation aliases only**: prose,
policy code, and dashboards, never transport.

| class | priority | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pinned` | 100 | TTL mandatory; server-capped (`--kv-cache-priority-max-ttl`, default 5m) |
| `high` | 50 | TTL optional (`--kv-cache-priority-default-ttl=30s`) |
| `normal` | — | unmarked; plain LRU |
| `evict-first` | −1 (extension) | see below |

Requiring a TTL for `pinned` is stricter than #37003's static-retention example
(priority 100, `duration=null`): the lease rule is what answers #23083's OOM objection,
so unbounded persistence is a server-side policy decision, not a client right
(divergence, §7).

**Extension: `evict-first` / ephemeral blocks.** #37003's two-queue evictor can only
retain *harder* than LRU — it cannot express "this block is worth *less* than unmarked
traffic." (Terminology trap: upstream describes priority 0 as "evict first," but a
marked priority-0 block still outlives every *unmarked* block, since the LRU free list
drains before the priority heap.) Our `evict-first` (−1) is genuinely below-normal: a
third bucket drained *before* the LRU free list. The vision doc's PE IV explicitly
wants this (early-evict intermediate `ReasoningBranch` thoughts; one-shot pollution in
this bench's workload model). Among the candidate shapes — dedicated queue, negative
priorities in the existing heap, or a boolean `ephemeral` flag — the dedicated queue
wins: negative priorities force every eviction through the heap, and the flag, while
simplest, still needs its own drain order anyway. To be filed as #37003 feedback — one
more queue, same zero-overhead-for-unmarked property.

Directive semantics (matching #37003 where possible + our lease rules):

- TTLs apply uniformly across all priority levels and count down in **wall-clock** time
  from directive receipt. Expiry demotes the block to unmarked — no unpin message
  needed. (#37003's design doc sketches `duration` as seconds *after last access* and
  marks expiry semantics TBD; wall-clock is our position to file as feedback, §7.
  Dynamic TTL extension can layer on later.)
- A later request touching the same blocks with no directive resets them to unmarked
  (mirrors the offline sim's `Node.admit` pin-clearing). Diverges from #37003's
  block-stamping rule — "any scope can escalate; only the owning scope can downgrade or
  clear" — see §7.
- Malformed directives are logged once and ignored — a hint never fails a request.
- Pins are soft under pressure: if every evictable block is marked and unexpired, evict
  the soonest-expiring and count a **pinned-pressure eviction** (the router's signal
  that it over-pinned). Capacity is never held hostage.

**Block sharing.** #37003 stamps priority on the *block*, not the request, because
blocks are shared: the same system-prompt blocks may back many sessions across many
`retention_scope`s. A whole-prefix router directive therefore touches blocks other
scopes depend on. The prototype's rule: a shared block carries the *maximum* of the
live directives covering it, and the reset-to-unmarked rule applies only when *no* live
directive covers the block. This matches upstream's escalate-freely posture while
making the demotion cases (reset, router ceiling) explicit divergences to negotiate
(§7); upstream's own open question on shared-block queue assignment is the right thread.

**Decode tokens are out of scope for the router path.** #37003 pairs
`RetentionDirective` with a `DecodeRetentionPolicy` for tokens generated during
decoding. The router only reasons about the prompt prefix (what its learned signals
describe), so decode-token retention stays framework-originated end-to-end.

### 2. Two transports, by hint origin

**Framework path (upstream-native):** `RetentionDirective`s in `extra_body` +
`retention_scope`, per #37003. The gateway and EPP pass these through untouched;
token-range scoping works here because the framework knows its segment boundaries
(SystemPrompt vs ToolDefinition vs ReasoningBranch — vision PE III).

**Router path (this RFC's addition):** a request header injected by the EPP after
scheduling:

```
x-kv-cache-priority: <int>[; ttl=<Go duration>][; scope=<id>]
```

- Scope is the **whole prefix** of the request it rides on — the router cannot see
  semantic segment boundaries, and the request's block-hash chain is the unit its
  learned signals (re-arrival gaps, request class) actually describe.
- A header because the extProc already runs in headers-SEND mode (no data-plane
  changes); mutating `extra_body` from the EPP would mean body buffering + rewriting on
  every request. #37003 already defines a JSON header (`X-KVCache-Retention-Policy`);
  we use a separate compact one because the router's directive is a fixed three-field
  tuple — flat `key=value` parsing stays trivial on both sides, no JSON encoding in the
  extProc. Whether router hints should instead reuse the upstream header is worth
  raising as #37003 feedback (§7); either way the backend normalizes both transports
  into the same internal representation.
- **Precedence — router ceiling.** When a framework directive and the router header
  cover the same blocks, the **router wins downward**: its value caps the effective
  priority, so a greedy or malicious client cannot pin harder than the fleet can
  afford. A bounded overshoot threshold lets a framework exceed the ceiling by a fixed
  margin — enough that well-behaved clients with genuinely better information aren't
  clamped, without per-client abuse tracking. This requires the router to *demote*,
  which #37003's scope-ownership rule forbids for non-owning scopes — the upstream ask
  is a privileged infrastructure scope (§7).
- Session identity: `retention_scope` when the client supplies it; otherwise the router
  derives a fallback scope from the prefix-hash chain its indexer already tracks. The
  derived fallback is what upstream likely needs specified — it works with zero client
  cooperation.
- EPP derives `ttl` from its retention horizon: `ttl = retain_until − now`.

### 3. Eviction mechanism

Normative semantics (the offline sim in `src/bench/sim/node.py` is the executable
spec): effective rank `evict-first < unmarked < priority ascending`, TTL expiry
collapses to unmarked; victim = min `(effective_rank, LRU position)` among evictable
blocks; all-marked → evict soonest-expiring + bump the pressure counter.

The sim fork mirrors #37003's proposed vLLM structure so the prototype exercises the
same mechanism upstream would ship: existing LRU `free_block_queue` for unmarked
blocks, a priority min-heap keyed `(effective_priority, last_freed_time)` for marked
ones, plus the evict-first bucket (our extension) drained first. Zero allocations or
checks for unmarked blocks — preserving #37003's "no overhead for non-agentic
workloads" principle.

### 4. Backward channel: stats

**Prometheus** (following the sim's existing `vllm:` naming and `model_name` labeling):

| Metric | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `vllm:kv_cache_priority_blocks{priority=...}` | gauge vec | resident marked blocks per class/priority band |
| `vllm:kv_cache_pinned_usage_perc` | gauge | marked-and-unexpired blocks / max blocks |
| `vllm:kv_cache_pinned_evictions_total` | counter | marked blocks evicted under pressure |

**ZMQ KVEvents**: append trailing fields to the existing `BlockStored` event — array
positions `[12] priority (int|nil)`, `[13] retain_until (float64 unix seconds|nil)`;
map-format keys `priority` / `retain_until`. Verified constraint: the deployed
`llm-d-kv-cache@v0.9.0` adapter[^11] ignores extra trailing fields on known
events but **fails the whole batch on an unknown event tag** — so no new event types in
v1; priority changes re-emit `BlockStored` (idempotent upsert, batched to manage update
volume), expiry computed by consumers from `retain_until`. This lines up with PoC 2's
"track semantic block types in the distributed indexer": the same two fields are what
the indexer needs. Typed semantic tags (SystemPrompt / ToolDefinition / ReasoningBranch
/ ExecutionCheckpoint — vision PE III) follow the same path: piggyback as trailing
fields first, then migrate to a versioned `BlockPriorityChanged` / semantic-tag event
once the API is stable and consumers negotiate, with a standard deprecation path.

**Bench metrics (PoC 3 alignment)**: beyond per-request TTFT, `bench report` should
surface the vision's program-level measures — session (program) completion time,
zero-recompute hit rate for returning sessions, pinned-cache utilization, and **TTFT by
turn position** (flat = cache failure; decreasing = prefix survival), matching #37003's
planned PoC evaluation. Every hint-on/off A/B run also reports **throughput on the
non-agentic control traffic** as a guardrail: #37003's first design principle is zero
overhead for unannotated workloads, and the evidence should demonstrate it, not assume
it.

### 5. EPP emission mechanism (llm-d-router side)

Verified against `llm-d-router v0.9.2` source: **no router patch is needed** for the
header path.

- A plugin implementing `requestcontrol.PreRequest` runs after scheduling
  (`pkg/epp/requestcontrol/director.go`) and before header serialization.
- `SchedulingRequest.Headers` aliases the request-context header map, and
  `handlers/request.go generateHeaders` serializes every non-system-owned header into
  the extProc `HeaderMutation` sent to Envoy → backend. `x-kv-cache-priority` is not
  system-owned.
- Plugins declared in `EndpointPickerConfig` are auto-wired into request control when
  they type-assert to `PreRequest`.

The prototype plugin (`src/gateway-plugin/`): classify the request (tool / rag /
oneshot, reusing `class_aware_reliability.go`), track per-tool re-arrival gaps (EWMA
mean + variance, matching `ToolGapIndex` in `src/bench/sim/policies.py`), and emit
`50; ttl=<mean·margin>; scope=<session>` on confident short predicted gaps, `-1` for
one-shots. Session identity per §2 (client `retention_scope` / `x-session-id`, falling
back to the router-derived prefix-hash scope).

**Routing interactions (v2).** Once the indexer sees pin state via the trailing event
fields, scorers should (a) prefer nodes holding a live pin for the session's prefix and
(b) penalize nodes reporting high pinned pressure (`vllm:kv_cache_pinned_usage_perc` /
`pinned_evictions_total`) — a node with no headroom to evict is a bad place to send new
work. Both directions are decided; their *weights* relative to existing scorers are an
open question.

### 6. Division of labor with the vision's pillars

| Vision pillar | This RFC's coverage |
|---|---|
| PE I program-aware scheduling | out of scope (orthogonal per #37003: block priority ≠ request priority) |
| PE II proactive state movement (Move/Pin/Evict control plane) | out of scope; the bench's Tier-2 KV-transfer gap is the local analog — future work |
| PE III semantic KV-cache (typed blocks) | partially: framework path carries ranges; typed tags deferred to v2 events |
| PE IV context-aware eviction | core of this RFC (= PoC 2, + the evict-first extension) |
| PE V workload-driven benchmarking | this repo is the instrument (= PoC 3); session workload + reliability signal are the canonical scenario ("Use Case 2: multi-turn ReAct loops") |

### 7. Divergences from #37003 (feedback to file)

Collected so the upstream conversation has one list; each is intentional, and each
lands as a comment on #37003 while its window is open (prototype plan step 5):

1. **`evict-first` / below-normal marking** (§1): a third queue drained before the LRU
   free list. PE IV needs *some* way to mark blocks worth less than unmarked traffic;
   #37003 currently can only retain harder.
2. **Demotion by the router** (§1, §2): the reset-to-unmarked rule and the router
   ceiling both require downgrading blocks a scope doesn't own, which #37003's "only
   the owning scope can downgrade" rule forbids. Proposed resolution: a privileged
   infrastructure scope for the routing layer — it sees fleet-wide pressure no single
   orchestrator can.
3. **TTL clock** (§1): wall-clock from receipt, uniform across priorities, vs the
   design doc's sketched seconds-after-last-access. Upstream marks expiry semantics
   TBD, so this is a proposal, not a fork.
4. **`pinned` requires a TTL** (§1): stricter than the persistent `duration=null`
   example; unbounded persistence should be server policy, not a client right.
5. **Compact router header** (§2): a flat header grammar alongside the upstream JSON
   `X-KVCache-Retention-Policy`, normalized server-side — or, if upstream prefers, the
   router emits the JSON header and this divergence disappears.

## Prototype plan (this repo)

Phased so each step is independently testable; EPP work is last (most uncertainty).

1. **Offline sim parity** — ✅ **done** (2026-07-15). Extended `Placement`/`Node` from
   `retain_until`-only to the priority vocabulary (new `src/bench/sim/priority.py`:
   `EVICT_FIRST=-1`, `HIGH=50`, `PINNED=100` + clamp; `node.py` now holds `(priority,
   expiry)` buckets with effective rank `evict-first < unmarked < priority asc`, TTL
   expiry collapsing to unmarked, and a `pinned_evictions` over-pin counter). The sim is
   now the executable spec of §3's priority model. Backward compatible — legacy
   `retain_until` maps to a HIGH lease (fuzz-verified byte-identical eviction); all prior
   tests pass unchanged. `ClassAwareReliability` emits HIGH on confident tool-session
   pins, EVICT_FIRST on one-shots.
2. **Sim fork honors directives** — ✅ **done** (2026-07-15). Forked
   `llm-d/llm-d-inference-sim` (submodule `third_party/llm-d-inference-sim`, branch
   `rfc-0001-retention-directives` off tag v0.9.2). The directive type, `x-kv-cache-priority`
   header parse, and clamp live in a new leaf package `pkg/retention` — not `pkg/common`,
   which already imports `openai-server-api` (import cycle). Rank-aware evictor in
   `pkg/kv-cache/block_cache.go` (per-block priority+expiry map + `pinnedEvictions`;
   `pickBlockToEvict` honors evict-first < unmarked < priority asc, TTL→unmarked,
   all-marked→soonest-expiring under pressure), with a `len(retention)==0` fast path
   preserving the exact upstream unloaded-first LRU. The directive flows request header →
   `openaiserverapi.Request` → `blockCache.startRequest`. Client-side escape hatch
   `bench traffic --kv-priority/-ttl/-scope` emits the header and proves the path before
   any EPP work (E2E: a pinned prefix survived filler pressure, `cached_tokens` 8 vs 0
   unmarked). Go tests in `pkg/retention` and `pkg/kv-cache`. The `extra_body`
   `RetentionDirective` parse is deferred — the header path needs no body plumbing, so it
   waits until a framework path actually needs it.
3. **Stats** — ✅ **done** (2026-07-16) for the core stat loop + ZMQ backchannel. §4 Prometheus
   metrics (`kv_cache_priority_blocks`, `pinned_usage_perc`, `pinned_evictions_total`) and
   trailing `BlockStored` event fields (`priority`, `retain_until`) in the fork, with a fork
   test asserting both compat directions against the real `llm-d-kv-cache@v0.9.0` adapter
   (extra trailing fields decode cleanly; an unknown event tag fails the whole batch — the
   constraint behind "no new event types in v1"). `bench metrics`/`report` grow pinned
   columns. The hint-on/off A/B harness and program-level measures (session-completion-time,
   zero-recompute rate, TTFT-by-turn) and the non-agentic throughput guardrail are **carried
   into phase 5** (see `rfc-0001-phase-3-plan.md`).
4. **EPP emission** — ✅ **done** (2026-07-17, see `rfc-0001-phase-4-plan.md`). Custom EPP
   image (`src/gateway-plugin`): llm-d-router v0.9.2's importable runner + an out-of-tree
   `kv-cache-priority` `PreRequest` plugin — per-tool EWMA gap index, per-conversation
   gap observation, §5's confidence-gated emission (`50; ttl=<window>; scope=<session>`
   on confident short gaps, `-1` for one-shots), and the §2 router-wins-downward
   precedence over client headers. `values.yaml` rewritten to the real GIE
   `inferencepool` v1.5.0 chart schema with an `EndpointPickerConfig` declaring the
   plugin. Discovery confirmed body-NONE starves *everything* (the extProc had never
   engaged; FailOpen masked it) — and the fix is `FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED`, not BUFFERED:
   Envoy's classic ext_proc lock-steps per message while llm-d-router defers the headers
   response until after body-driven scheduling. Also required: plaintext h2c to the EPP
   (`--secure-serving=false` + an `appProtocol: kubernetes.io/h2c` service port),
   kgateway pinned v2.3.6 (v2.2 dropped Envoy-plane InferencePool backends; v2.1.x
   images crash on ARM64), and turning on the sim's block cache
   (`--enable-kvcache`, `POD_IP`, `--max-model-len=32768`) — without which all prior
   in-cluster directive traffic had been silent no-ops. E2E: the EPP autonomously marked
   200–280 HIGH blocks during a paced tool-session run and 7 evict-first blocks per
   one-shot, with zero client-supplied directives. The EPP's endpoint *pick* is ignored
   by the plain-Service routes (native pool routing needs an agentgateway/Istio
   migration) — routing interactions were already deferred to v2 (§5).
5. **Evidence + upstream feedback** — ✅ **done** (2026-07-18, see
   `rfc-0001-phase-5-plan.md`). `bench report` gained a hint-on/off A/B (directive
   emission route-gated in the EPP plugin so `prefix-affinity` runs the identical path
   with directives off), the PoC-3 program measures (TTFT-by-turn, session completion
   time, zero-recompute rate), peak (`max_over_time`) pinned queries, and the Prometheus
   pod-annotation scrape fix (a duplicate-key bug had been silently dropping the job).
   Evidence[^13]: the mechanism runs end-to-end (on-arm pins 6.1–6.6% of cache, off-arm
   0%, no client directives), but on this workload retention gives **no** reuse benefit
   — the EPP pins short-gap sessions LRU already keeps warm, so zero-recompute is flat
   across arms — and under cache pressure it reproduces the over-pinning collapse
   (pins 52%, success 100%→89%, throughput 2.5→1.7). The non-agentic guardrail shows
   zero overhead. Results + the §7 divergence list are written up in
   `rfc-0001-upstream-feedback.md`, ready to post to #37003. Caveat: the sim's TTFT is a
   fixed latency model, so this testbed measures cache occupancy and the over-pinning
   failure mode, not the latency win of prefix reuse.

## Open questions (iterate here)

1. **Router-ceiling threshold**: how much may a framework directive exceed the router's
   ceiling before it is clamped? A fixed margin avoids per-client abuse tracking, but
   the right magnitude needs the fairness simulation below to calibrate.
2. **Routing weights (v2)**: preferring live-pin nodes and penalizing high pinned
   pressure are decided directions (§5), but the weighting against existing scorers is
   unclear — as is the shape of the calculation combining all routing factors. Needs
   the bench's A/B machinery pointed at routing, not just eviction.
3. **Multi-tenant fairness**: per-client or per-`retention_scope` pin budgets, or is
   max-TTL cap + pressure metric enough for v1? (#37003 is silent on budgets.)
   Important but deferred — needs dedicated fairness simulation work; revisit after the
   prototype phases land. Early evidence this is real, not hypothetical: the phase-1 sim
   already shows `class-aware-reliability` losing tool-class hit rate to plain
   `class-aware` at some cache sizes — concurrent sessions' pins evict each other under
   contention, worse than letting LRU pick the true least-recently-used block[^12]. The
   `pinned_evictions` counter (§4) tracks it; whether a pressure metric alone is enough
   to self-correct, or a budget is needed, is exactly what this open question asks.
